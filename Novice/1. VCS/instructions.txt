To demonstrate the use of Git as a Version Control System (VCS) on a local machine, simulating a team with multiple users (team leader and coders), weâ€™ll go through a step-by-step setup and execution. This will include creating users, branching, merging, and comparing the features with SVN.

### Prerequisites:
- Install Git on the local machine.
- Configure a local repository to act as a shared workspace.

### Step 1: Setup Users and Repository
1. **Create a Local Repository**:
   ```bash
   mkdir project_repo
   cd project_repo
   git init --bare
   ```
   This `project_repo` will act as a central repository for the team.

2. **Create User Profiles**:
   We'll simulate multiple users by using separate directories and Git configurations. 

   **Team Leader Setup**:
   ```bash
   mkdir leader_workspace
   cd leader_workspace
   git clone ../project_repo
   cd project_repo
   git config user.name "Team Leader"
   git config user.email "leader@example.com"
   ```

   **Coder 1 Setup**:
   ```bash
   mkdir coder1_workspace
   cd coder1_workspace
   git clone ../project_repo
   cd project_repo
   git config user.name "Coder1"
   git config user.email "coder1@example.com"
   ```

   **Coder 2 Setup**:
   ```bash
   mkdir coder2_workspace
   cd coder2_workspace
   git clone ../project_repo
   cd project_repo
   git config user.name "Coder2"
   git config user.email "coder2@example.com"
   ```

### Step 2: Creating and Committing Changes
1. **Coder 1 Adds a Feature**:
   ```bash
   cd coder1_workspace
   cd project_repo
   echo "print('Feature 1')" > feature1.py
   git add feature1.py
   git commit -m "Coder1: Add feature 1"
   git push
   ```

2. **Coder 2 Adds Another Feature**:
   ```bash
   cd coder2_workspace
   cd project_repo
   git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
   echo "print('Feature 2')" > feature2.py
   git add feature2.py
   git commit -m "Coder2: Add feature 2"
   git push
   ```

3. **Team Leader Merges Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd leader_workspace
   cd project_repo
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Branching (Forking) and Merging
1. **Create a Branch for Feature 3 by Coder 1**:
   ```bash
   cd coder1_workspace
   cd project_repo
   git checkout -b feature-3
   echo "print('Feature 3')" > feature3.py
   git add feature3.py
   git commit -m "Coder1: Add feature 3 on new branch"
   git push origin feature-3
   ```

2. **Team Leader Merges Feature-3 Branch**:
   ```bash
   cd leader_workspace
   cd project_repo
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge feature-3
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Code Diff and Conflict Resolution
1. **Coder 2 Modifies Feature 1 Causing a Conflict**:
   ```bash
   cd coder2_workspace
   echo "print('Feature 1 Updated by Coder2')" > feature1.py
   git add feature1.py
   git commit -m "Coder2: Update feature 1"
   git push origin main
   ```
   
2. **Resolve Conflict by Team Leader**:
   ```bash
   cd leader_workspace
   git pull origin main
   # Resolve conflict manually in feature1.py
   git add feature1.py
   git commit -m "Resolve conflict in feature1.py"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Comparing Git with SVN

| Feature                   | Git                                                  | SVN                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Versioning**            | Distributed VCS                                      | Centralized VCS                                |
| **Branching/Forking**     | Lightweight, supports multiple workflows             | Branching is heavier and often discouraged     |
| **Commit History**        | Each user maintains a local history                  | Only server keeps a full history               |
| **Merging**               | Powerful merging and conflict resolution tools       | Manual merges, more limited                    |
| **Offline Work**          | Full offline capabilities with local repo copies     | Requires server connection for most actions    |
| **Roles and Permissions** | Customizable permissions using hooks and configs     | Permissions managed at server level           |

This covers the basics of setting up a Git-based team environment with multiple roles and common version control actions like branching, merging, and comparing changes, along with a basic comparison to SVN. Let me know if you'd like any more specific details or additional features included.
